# Eastroller
The objective of this project is to design a human-powered vehicle for newborn to toddler-aged children. Given this design objective, similar products such as strollers and slings were analyzed along with their shortcoming. Concepts were generated to accommodate for largest population and refined to one design. A prototype of the final design was created to assess the functionality, usability, and producibility.
